Add an extra column with the ID term to your taxonomies (Tags, Catgeories or Custom Taxonomies) so you can sort your terms by date.

== Description ==

Have you tried to find out which one from your tags was created first? Or Which term for your custom taxonomy was last created? 

Last one happens to me, I had so many terms on several custom taxonomies that I wanted to know which ones were last created. The problem is that there is no record of the publish date on the wp_terms table from the WP Database. But since IDs are auto-incremental we can use this field to order by date our terms.

So I added an extra sortable column with the ID term to your taxonomies (Tags, Catgeories or Custom Taxonomies).

By default Tags and Categories pages will have the extra column. If you want to add the extra ID / Date column to your custom taxonomies go to the plugin settings page at Settings -> IDATERMS.

== Installation ==

Install like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page. By default Tags and Categories pages will have the extra column. If you want to add the extra ID / Date column to your custom taxonomies go to the plugin settings page at Settings -> IDATERMS.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. If you need to know the ID of any term quick and easy.
